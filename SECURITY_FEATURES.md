### Key Classes and Functions
```typescript
// Token Scanner Integration
const tokenScanner = new TokenScanner();
const analysis = await tokenScanner.analyzeToken(address);

// Sei Registry Integration
const seiRegistry = new SeiTokenRegistry(false); // mainnet
const tokenInfo = await seiRegistry.getTokenInfo(address);

// Reown Wallet Connection
const { connectWallet, disconnectWallet, isConnected } = useReownWallet();

// AI Chat Data Service
const dataService = new AIChatDataService();
const watchedTokens = await dataService.getWatchedTokens();
```

## 🌐 Environment Configuration
